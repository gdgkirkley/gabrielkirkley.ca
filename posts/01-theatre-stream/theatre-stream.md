I've been getting asked a lot recently about how theatres can stream their
shows to ticket buyers, and what equipment is needed to do this really well.

Over the course of the past eight months, I've worked on all aspects of a
streaming production: in front of the camera as an actor, directing actors for
the camera, directing the cameras themselves, and managing the delivery of
streaming or recorded content to patrons.

In a future post, I'll talk a little about how to distribute your streams to
ticket buyers, but for now, this is just about the equipment to get you up and running.

## A disclaimer

This doesn't mean that you *need* to get any expensive equipment. If the
theatre company or group you're working with can only afford to use an iPhone to
record, then that will work perfectly! In fact, the quality of a newer iPhone
may actually be better than a lot of the prosumer equipment out there.

For the first level up from a single stationary phone, I recommend
[checking out NDI](https://www.ndi.tv/tools/). With a tiny budget and no camera
operators, you could set up several phones running the
[NDI camera app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ndi-hx-camera/id1477266080?ls=1)
throughout a theatre. Then, using NDI's technical wizardry and a program like
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can add all those cameras as sources and cut
between them to produce a pretty slick streaming production.

On the other hand, if you have a small budget to spend, here are my equipment
recommendations:

### Production Switcher

This is your most important piece of equipment, and to my mind, there is really only
one option in this category:

**[BlackMagic ATEM Mini](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B086R79PBC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B086R79PBC&linkCode=as2&tag=readingly0f-20&linkId=38b7808e7aea7dba1fcbedc7ed04fd52)
production switcher - $435 - $1,030 CAD**

I love the BlackMagic ATEM line and can't recommend it highly enough.

With this little gadget, you can connect up to four cameras at once via an HDMI cable,
along with two additional audio sources via 3.5mm jacks. It will even let you output
all of that to a monitor with a multiview layout that will make switching cameras and
graphics a breeze.

One thing that I've found really useful is that it will also connect directly to any
computer via a USB-C cable and, once connected, it will register as a webcam. That means
that you can use the live output of the ATEM in Zoom, Google Hangouts, Youtube Live,
Facebook Live, Twitch, or really any streaming platform you can think of.

I've even connected the audio output of an iMac running QLab. That means you can playback
show audio for the livestream through the ATEM and have a single operator run it all from one
computer!

### Cameras

Cameras are a bit more dependent on your ultimate price range. Keeping in mind that you will
want to have at least 2 and up to 4 of these cameras, here are my recommendations:

**[Sony Alpha A6400 Mirrorless Camera](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07MV3P7M8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B07MV3P7M8&linkCode=as2&tag=readingly0f-20&linkId=ff29229fc9d8444e2839e063ef8a1d74) - $1,348 CAD**

Paired with a low f-stop lens in the 1.4-2.4 range, this is a perfect camera for streaming
that won't require too much camera operation.
