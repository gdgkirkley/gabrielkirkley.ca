Let's face it. There are SO many resources for learning React online.

React is the most popular JavaScript framework around, so it's no surprise that
there are tutorials for every topic imaginable. That's fantastic for when you're
an established developer. But what about when you're trying to learn for the
first time?

It can be overwhelming! There are so many results and you don't know anything
about React, so how are you supposed to be able to judge which course will be
best for you? Or which ones are even good? Do you really want to give your money
to someone that you're not even sure will teach you what you want to know?

I get it. Just a few years ago, I learned React on my own, just by taking
tutorials online. To help you and everyone who is looking for a place to start,
I've put together this list of the best resources out there.

All of the courses and tutorials that I recommend I have actually taken myself.
Trust me, there are lots that I've taken and just left out entirely. For
example, you'll notice that I've left off the place where most beginners go:
Udemy courses. I've taken quite a few of them. There are some instructors on
Udemy who are quite good (Stephen Grider is one of them) but for the most part,
I found that those courses are bloated, outdated, and ultimately fairly
unhelpful in really learning the concepts.

Every resource that I recommend has a price attached to it. That's partly
because I believe in paying creators for their work and I think you should too.
But also, these are really high quality courses. If you take any of the courses
on this list, you will have a leg up on all the others trying to learn from
lower quality courses.

Last thing before we dive into the list: **don't get stuck in tutorial hell.**
If you've already taken a course or two, the best thing you can do right now is
to think up a basic little project and start building it on your own. You will
learn so much more just by doing it yourself.

## Epic React from Kent C Dodds

This is easily my #1 suggestion for learning React. Kent is an amazing
instructor, and he will take you from absolute beginner to knowing React inside
and out quickly.

I took this course after building a few projects in React and although I thought
that I knew it pretty well, it turned out that there was still so much more to
learn.

Plus, the course has just been updated to include React 18!
