## The Idea

One of the pain points for any company that relies on part-time labour is
scheduling staff shifts. At the company that I work for, it's made even more
complicated by the union agreements that regulate when specific staff can work
and who gets priority for a given shift. Unfortunately, those rules make it
impossible to use most of the available scheduling platforms out there.

For a long time, that meant that the managers at my company would use a
combination of paper and email to create schedules, post shifts, and track who
was working.

When I moved into the role that I'm in now, I knew that one of my priorities was
building an application that would allow quick, painless and easy scheduling for
staff and managers.

## The Tech

The application runs on React on for the frontend and NodeJS/Express for the
backend with a PostgreSQL database. It's the first full-scale React application
that I built, and I learned so much throughout the process!

From building out an extensible database schema to designing well thought out
user interfaces, from enforcing business rules in the API to debugging edge
cases in complex interactions, this was a complicated project from beginning to
end.

## The Best Part

My favourite part of developing the app was building out a release schedule,
implementing semantic versioning, setting up issue tracking, and using Github's
Kanban project boards to track progress.

Although I was the primary developer on the project, I had several colleagues
actively involved in the development process. We would meet regularly to discuss
features, bugs, and design. From those meetings, I would detail technical
requirements and create a roadmap for release in two weeks sprints.

Here is an example release:

---

_Hi all –_

_Version 0.5.0 of the scheduling app has just gone to test!_

_This has three pretty big new features. Please logout and login again before
taking a look in the app itself._

## _New Features:_

### _User Groups_

_I've implemented user groups! That means that data across the whole application
segments according to these groups – there is no way to see the schedules and
data of other groups and vice versa._

_Users can be part of multiple user groups (accounting for the case when we have
someone who works in various departments), and they can select which user group
they would like when logging in._

_Only reference data lives between user groups (locations and statuses)_

_Also, note that this is a significant change – let's be on the lookout for
bugs!_

### _Global Schedule Preferences_

_Users can now specify global availability across all schedules – i.e., I can't
ever work on Sundays._

_This displays for admin users when creating schedules, so that they know why
someone may or may not have added a bid._

### _Seniority Calculation_

_The app now has a screen for admin users to update the seniority points for a
given user. It will automatically calculate how many points the app thinks
should be added. Still, I recommend double-checking that manually against the
schedule to ensure that it's correct, especially in the initial stages. Admin
users can adjust the seniority points to add (or subtract) manually._

### _Minor Updates:_

- _Design updates throughout the application_

- _Reports have a separate button to run each report instead of one main
  buttonn_

- _Major refactor of how modals work in the Shift page, which does not affect
  how it works or appears, but makes it MUCH more maintainable._

At the end of the project, it was incredible to see how much easier it would
make our team's lives, saving dozens of hours of staff time in just a single
quarter.
