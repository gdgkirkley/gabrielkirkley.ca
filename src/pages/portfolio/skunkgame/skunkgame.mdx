import SkunkGame from "../../../components/skunkgame";

This is a console game written in Java which was built for BCIT's Introduction
to Software Development II course. It was built before we learned about
polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, etc. so it's mainly meant to
demonstrate our understanding of inheritance.

You can see the original Java code
[here](https://github.com/gdgkirkley/bcit-comp1451-skunk). But I've rewritten it
in Javascript so that you can play it below!
