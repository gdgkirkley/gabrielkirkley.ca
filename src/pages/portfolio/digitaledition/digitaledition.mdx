### The Idea

In March 2020, the global pandemic due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns sent
the entertainment industry into a spiral. Within days, the company I work for
had to cancel all its shows, and the theatres were empty.

From the crisis, I built the **Digital Edition**.

### The Tech

It's a React application on the frontend and a Node/Express application on the
backend with a PostgreSQL database.

It features:

- Full **authentication** with web tokens and session management
- Stable **integration with third-party software** like Tessitura and Zoom
- **Social interactions** with likes and comments
- **Workshop/event registration**

### The Best Part

My favourite part of building the site was adding pagination and randomization
for getting videos from the API.

When a user is on the site, we wanted to make sure that they wouldn't always see
the same videos in each group. Plus, we had a feature section that displayed
"more videos" to the user, and it would be kinda boring if the same two videos
were always listed there. A machine learning model for recommending videos was
outside the scope of this project (and unnecessary), so I needed to be able to
retrieve data from the database at random and allow for pagination.

I knew that a potential solution was to order the videos by their ID **and** a
modulo of the ID. In other words, retrieving truly random results isn't
necessary - just a shuffled, repeatable order.

Initially, I had it set up to use a single modulus (7), but it quickly became
apparent that this presented the same problem: shuffled results, sure, but they
were always the same! Getting a genuinely random number as the modulus was
vital. Here is what I added on the backend:

```js
query.orderByRaw(`video.id % ${randomizer}, video.id`);
```

Now, the user got random videos, but duplicated again and again! The order
fetched from the database needed to be repeatable to prevent duplicates. So I
knew that this was a job for some good old React state.

In the final solution on the frontend, I get a random number between 2 and 11
and store it in state. Here's what that looks like:

```js
const [randomizer] = useState(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) + 2);
```

This way, on the next fetch to the database, there is a repeatable order to the
returned results and no duplicates on the frontend!
