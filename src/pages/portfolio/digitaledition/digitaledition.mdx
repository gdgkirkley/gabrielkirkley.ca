### The Idea

In March 2020, the global pandemic due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns sent
the entertainment industry into a spiral. Suddenly, all of our theatres were
empty and shows were cancelled.

From the crisis, I built the **Digital Edition**.

### The Tech

It's a React application on the frontend, and a Node/Express application on the
backend with a PostgreSQL database.

It features:

- Full **authentication** with web tokens and session management
- Stable **integration with third-party software** like Tessitura and Zoom
- **Social interactions** with likes and comments
- **Workshop/event registration**

### The Best Part

My favourite part of building the site was developing the algorithm for
retrieving randomized but repeatable results for getting videos from the API.

It was a tough problem because I knew that developing a true recommendation
engine was outside the scope of this project. Therefore, I needed to be able to
retrieve data from the database at random, but also allow for pagination through
those results.

The solution was to order the videos by their id **and** a modulo of the id and
a randomizer variable sent from the frontend.

```js
query.orderByRaw(`video.id % ${randomizer}, video.id`)
```
