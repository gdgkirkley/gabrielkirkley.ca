### The Idea

Casting hypothetical shows and movies is one of the favourite past times of the
theatrically inclined. I knew that I wanted to try using Google Firebase as the
backend on a project, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to build out a
fun little app. Users create accounts, search for shows (or add a new play if it
doesn't exist), cast a show, and save their casts to their account!

### The Tech

I used React to develop the frontend of the site and integrated Firestore as the
database. It was my first time working with a NoSQL database, and while I missed
some of the advantages of a relational model, the flexibility and scalability of
NoSQL are fantastic.

I had a great time working on the drag and drop interface, accessibility for
various components, and the search functionality.

### The Best Part

My favourite part of working on the app was building out the search
functionality. I knew that I need to allow users to find the shows that they
were looking for quickly, but one of the tradeoffs of a NoSQL database is that
searching can be more complicated.

To solve the problem, I researched common search patterns, especially those
using keywords. When a user inputs a new play or musical into the database, I
split the title into keywords, filter out stop words, and then create an array
on the document. Plus, the user can add keywords of their choosing.

When running a search query, I can use the "array-contains" method within
Firestore to retrieve records containing that keyword. It's not a robust
solution and might not hold up to scale, but for this project, it works like a
charm.

```js
const handleSubmit = async e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const lowerSearch = search.toLowerCase();
  const titleSearch = titleCase(search);
  let results = [];

  let result = await Promise.all([
    firestore
      .collection("shows")
      .where("keywords", "array-contains", lowerSearch)
      .orderBy("title")
      .limit(50)
      .get(),
    firestore
      .collection("shows")
      .where("title", "==", titleSearch)
      .limit(5)
      .get(),
  ]).catch(err => {
    setErr(err.message);
  });
  if (result) {
    result.map(query => {
      return query.docs.map(doc => {
        const data = doc.data();
        const id = doc.id;
        return results.push({ ...data, id });
      });
    });
    const finalResult = Array.from(new Set(results.map(show => show.id))).map(
      id => {
        return {
          id: id,
          ...results.find(show => show.id === id),
        };
      }
    );
    props.getResults(finalResult, search);
  }
};
```
